**A4B - Music Kowloon City:** Issue 01 /jlchristian.com 2007 - 2008

This inaugural issue brings focus to KC93, the music production division born from the kinetic energy of Kowloon City. KC93 represents more than a production hub—it’s a conceptual ecosystem where sound becomes a medium for storytelling, innovation, and cultural dialogue. Each project under KC93 is a reflection of deliberate design, merging technical mastery with the raw energy of inspiration to craft sonic experiences that resonate on a profound level.

Leaning more in the spirit of freedom of A4B!, I start working with more on the backflip aspect of the idea. The idea was for it to be a digital magazine that focus not just on anime but art and artist alike.
