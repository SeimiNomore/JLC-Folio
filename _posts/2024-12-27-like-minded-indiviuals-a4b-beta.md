**Journal Entry**  

Kowloon was a place that I deeply appreciated. The fact that it was once considered a [world wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_World) made it even more intriguing. I had been searching for a concept that would represent the music label **KC.93 RR / Records & Radio**. With many musicians expressing interest in collaborating and contributing to **[Anime4breakfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)**, I was often asked to create a label they could rally under. That inquiry eventually gave birth to **Kowloon City 93**.  

The aesthetic and mystery of **Anime4breakfast** had always been central to its appeal. When brainstorming for KC.93 RR, I sought something equally enigmatic. The inspiration came from the haunting allure of **[Gunkanjima Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island)**, an abandoned island in Japan. However, it was the **[Walled City of Kowloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City)** that truly embodied the ideal. Its dense, layered history and reputation as an urban labyrinth felt like the perfect fit for the label’s concept—an intricate and mysterious structure mirroring the ethos of the artists involved.

The concept for the Deval and Miles Timothy advertisement was born from a collection of conversations with Miles Timothy, during which he introduced me to his brother, a fellow creative whose talents became integral to anime4breakfast. Reflecting on the dynamic between the two brothers, I envisioned this project as the perfect introduction to the collective artistry of Duval Timothy.

During this time in the development of Anime4Breakfast (A4B!), I came across so many people who genuinely appreciated the idea. It was both surprising and inspiring to find so many creatives who shared the same passion. One of those people was Sucka Free, a talented photographer originally from Florida who eventually made his way to New York.  

Our paths crossed at a pivotal moment when we were both focused on building our portfolios. It felt natural to collaborate, blending his photography with the aesthetic vision of A4B!. Together, we worked on several A4B! ads, each one helping to refine and elevate the brand’s style. These collaborations not only pushed the aesthetic forward but also reminded me how much creative energy can come from working with like-minded individuals.
