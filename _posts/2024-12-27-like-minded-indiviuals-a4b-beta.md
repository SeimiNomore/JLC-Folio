This was the beginnning of it all the first ads for anime4breakfast! -- going off of the **JoyBoy** logo, creating that this ads just followed that concept.

The concept for the Deval and Miles Timothy advertisement was born from a collection of conversations with Miles Timothy, during which he introduced me to his brother, a fellow creative whose talents became integral to anime4breakfast. Reflecting on the dynamic between the two brothers, I envisioned this project as the perfect introduction to the collective artistry of Duval Timothy.

During this time in the development of Anime4Breakfast (A4B!), I came across so many people who genuinely appreciated the idea. It was both surprising and inspiring to find so many creatives who shared the same passion. One of those people was Sucka Free, a talented photographer originally from Florida who eventually made his way to New York.  

Our paths crossed at a pivotal moment when we were both focused on building our portfolios. It felt natural to collaborate, blending his photography with the aesthetic vision of A4B!. Together, we worked on several A4B! ads, each one helping to refine and elevate the brandâ€™s style. These collaborations not only pushed the aesthetic forward but also reminded me how much creative energy can come from working with like-minded individuals.
