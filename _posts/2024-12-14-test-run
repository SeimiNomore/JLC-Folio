I absolutely love your pixel art and the incredible functionality you’ve managed to pack into such small characters. I’m a big fan of detailed design in compact forms, whether it’s pixel characters or tiny devices. That’s actually what drew me to River City Underground—I’m into that aesthetic for exactly the same reason. Interestingly enough, I’ve been aiming to create a similar game myself, almost serendipitously. I’ve even designed a few characters of my own—I’d love to hear your thoughts on them!
